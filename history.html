She is the second female justice (after Sandra Day O'Connor) of four to be confirmed to the court. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the court. Ginsburg has received attention in American popular culture for her fiery liberal dissents and refusal to step down; she has been dubbed the "Notorious R.B.G."

          Ginsburg earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University, and became a wife and mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. She transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated tied for first in her class.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ginsburg spent a considerable part of her legal career as an advocate for the advancement of gender equality and women's rights, winning multiple victories arguing before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsels in the 1970s.
